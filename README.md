# Notes
This repository contains http implementation in Python.

The structure and contents of the code follows the Course (details of the Course is attached below) as closely as possible.
It is also worth mentioning that the Course platform is freemium, i.e. the content of the course is freely available and the quizes are accesible.
Some features, such as quiz and solution submission, are only available through membership.

There might be slight divergence due to two reasons: the Course is instructed in Go and the solution is attempted without the subscription to the platform.

As an alternative, the Video (see below for details) provided helpful guidance and hints as to what the output of the correct solution looks like.
